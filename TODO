-- When writing strings to the db (e.g., 'mandatory' or 'must') make sure
   to write a canonical value so searches work properly (i.e., we don't
   have to search for both keywords, just the canonical one)

-- Verify that when depends/implies relationships are added, the reqts
   already exist

-- Provide a check function for spec YAML, not just reqt YAML

-- Document spec YAML like reqt YAML

-- Add db indexes for search?
